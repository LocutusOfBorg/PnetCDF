This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New features
  + BP file read capability is now supported -- PnetCDF can be built on top of
    ADIOS library to read files in BP format. Note write capability is not
    supported. This feature is provided for convenience purpose. The parallel
    I/O performance to BP files is expected no difference from using ADIOS
    library directly. More information can be found in doc/README.ADIOS.md.

* New optimization
  + none

* New Limitations
  + Writing to BP files is not supported.

* Update configure options
  + Enable ADIOS BP file support.
    - `--enable-adios`: enables read capability for BP files
    - `--with-adios=/path/to/netcdf-4`: can be used to specify the path to
      ADIOS library installation
  + Option `--with-netcdf4` now allows a form of `--with-netcdf4=INC,LIB` in
    addition to `--with-netcdf4=DIR`. This is in case the include and lib
    folders of NetCDF-4 installation are in different locations.

* New constants
  + NC_BP, NF_BP, and NF90_BP are the flags indicating BP file access mode.
  + NC_FORMAT_BP, NF_FORMAT_BP, and NF90_FORMAT_BP indicate BP file format.

* New APIs
  + none

* API syntax changes
  + none

* API semantics updates
  + none

* New error code precedence
  + none

* Updated error strings
  + none

* New error code
  + NC_EADIOS, NF_EADIOS, NF90_EADIOS - indicate an ADIOS library internal
    error that does not corresponds to any PnetCDF error code.

* New PnetCDF hint
  + none

* New run-time environment variables
  + none

* Build recipes
  + none

* New/updated utility program
  + `cdfdiff` is a new utility program. It is a serial version of `ncmpidiff`
    that is compiled with gcc without PnetCDF library. It can run on the login
    node in a cross-compile environment. `cdfdiff` only compares files in the
    classic NetCDF formats, i.e. CDF-1, CDF-2, and CDF-5.
  + `ncmpidiff` now checks file format versions of two files, and reports
    difference if not the same. Even if formats are different, it continues to
    compare the contents of file headers and values in variables.
  + A new option `-t` is added to `ncmpidiff` to compare variables with
    tolerance. See the man page of `ncmpidiff` for usage. Thanks to Carl Ponder
    for contributing the source codes. See
    [PR #53](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/53)
  + `ncmpidump` can now dump BP files.

* Other updates:
  + The MPI info object now includes all PnetCDF hints once obtained from a
    call to ncmpi_inq_file_info(), even if the hints are not set by the users.

* Bug fixes
  + When calling a nonblocking API with a zero-length request and argument
    request ID being NULL, segmentation fault may occur. See
    [PR #51](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF/pull/51)

* New example programs
  + examples/adios/read_metadata.c - dumps metadata of a BP file.
  + examples/adios/read_var.c - reads a variable from a BP file generated by
    the ADIOS example program examples/C/arrays/arrays_write.
  + examples/adios/read_var_nb.c - reads a variable from a BP file generated
    by the  ADIOS example program examples/C/arrays/arrays_write using PnetCDF
    non-blocking API.

* New programs for I/O benchmarks
  + none

* New test program
  + test/adios/open.c - tests if PnetCDF recognize BP file.
  + test/adios/header.c - tests if PnetCDF can parse BP header.
  + test/adios/var.c - tests if PnetCDF can read variables from a BP file
  + test/adios/varm.c - tests PnetCDF varm APIS for reading a BP file
  + test/adios/vars.c - tests PnetCDF vars APIs for reading a BP file
  + test/adios/ivar.c - tests PnetCDF nonblocking API for reading a BP file
  + test/adios/ivarm.c - tests PnetCDF nonblocking varm APIs for reading a BP
    file
  + test/adios/ivars.c - tests PnetCDF nonblocking vars APIs for reading a BP
    file
  + test/adios/att.c - tests PnetCDF for reading attributes from a BP file
  + test/adios/indep.c - tests PnetCDF for reading a BP file in independent
    data mode
  + test/burst_buffer/varn.c -- tests PnetCDF varn APIs when burst buffer
    driver is used. The test includes cases when argument counts contains some
    of the elements being NULL.
  + test/nc4/notsupport.c - test if error code NC_ENOTSUPPORT is properly
    returned when calling APIs for unsupported NetCDF-4 feature.
  + test/nc4/tst_rec_vars.c - tests writing and reading record variables from
    a NetCDF-4 file
  + test/nc4/rec2 - tests reading a record variables with 2 unlimited
    dimensions from a NetCDF-4 file.

* Conformity with NetCDF library
  + none

* Discrepancy from NetCDF library
  + none

* Issues related to MPI library vendors:
  + none

* Issues related to Darshan library:
  + none

* Clarifications
  + none
